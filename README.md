# EDA-for-Understanding-Workforce-Attrition


# Description: 
This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an HR dataset aimed at uncovering key patterns and trends in employee attrition. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains detailed records about employee demographics, job roles, performance, compensation, and attrition status.

The main objective is to understand the factors contributing to employee turnover by examining the relationships between various features and attrition. This includes identifying high-risk groups, exploring salary patterns, analyzing job satisfaction, and uncovering any performance-related anomalies.

Using a combination of univariate and bivariate analysis techniques, the project investigates both individual variable distributions and interactions between key factors such as age, job role, income, performance rating, and overtime.

The insights gained from this EDA can support HR teams and recruiters in identifying retention strategies, optimizing compensation structures, and targeting areas that need intervention.
